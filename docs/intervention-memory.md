# Immutable intervention experience records

`intervention_memory.InterventionMemory` implements issues #95 and #96 as an offline
append-only store. It does not enable memory retrieval, select development data,
update fixed-memory evaluation snapshots, or authorize an intervention.

The trusted host retains four pieces of evidence:

- `attempt.json`, written before policy control by `AttemptIdentityRecorder`,
  including `task.instruction`, `policy_assets`, `settings.action_capabilities`
  (the serialized `ActionCapabilities`), and the frozen supervisor reference.
- The supervisor identity file referenced by `supervisor_manifest` and
  `supervisor_sha256` in that attempt.
- A decision-context JSON file retained at selection time. It has exactly
  `episode_id`, `proposal_id`, `observation_sequence`, `diagnosis`, and `request`.
  The diagnosis uses the temporal-diagnosis schema (`category`, `summary`,
  `evidence`, optional `conflicts`). The request is the original adjustment wire
  request or the serialized recovery request retained in the recovery sequence.
- The completed episode's `trace/manifest.json`, published by `TraceRecorder.seal`.
  Its observation and decision hashes are checked through `load_recorded_replay`.

Retain each expected SHA-256 when its producer publishes the evidence. Do not
reconstruct a missing diagnosis or request from subsequent success, or compute a
new expected digest to bless changed evidence. Legacy episodes without complete
provenance are rejected. The host is responsible for the truth and timing of
retained context; hashing does not establish authorship or model immutability.

```python
from intervention_memory import InterventionMemory

memory = InterventionMemory("evidence/memory")
reference = memory.append(
    trace=("evidence/episode/trace/manifest.json", trace_sha256),
    attempt=("evidence/episode/attempt.json", attempt_sha256),
    supervisor=("evidence/episode/supervisor.json", supervisor_sha256),
    context=("evidence/episode/context.json", context_sha256),
)
# Keep this reference in the consuming manifest, independently of the store.
record = memory.read(reference["record_id"], expected_sha256=reference["sha256"])
```

The result includes task, robot capabilities, policy/supervisor identities,
effective configuration, diagnosis, request, acknowledged execution rows, and
the sealed episode outcome. Multiple recovery actions stay in one record, keyed
by the initiating episode/proposal. Recovery completion or abort checks remain
distinct from task success. An acknowledged adjustment with an unknown diagnosis
is preserved as unknown; the store provides no diagnostic or execution approval.
Rejected or unconfirmed actions are not completed intervention records.

New records use schema version 2 and expose `local_outcome` separately from
`episode_outcome`. The local status comes only from retained execution evidence:

| Local status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `completed` | The recovery monitor confirmed the local completion conditions. |
| `aborted` | The recovery monitor stopped or cancelled the sequence; `reason` retains the exact cause. |
| `unknown` | No conclusive local check exists. A last `continuing` check yields `no_terminal_local_check`; adjustments without a local assessor yield `no_local_assessment`. |

An acknowledged adjustment is not automatically beneficial. Nor does completed
recovery establish task success or causal benefit: it can precede task failure.
Conversely, a task can succeed with an aborted recovery. Current execution cancels
recovery on terminal task results (`episode_terminated`); historical traces can
retain a failed local assessment alongside terminal success. These cases preserve
their separate outcomes and reasons. An abort due to unknown evidence or terminal
cancellation is not a claim that the correction caused harm.

Version 1 records remain verifiable and readable in their original schema,
without adding a field or rewriting their immutable bytes. Consumers must treat
an absent local outcome as unknown, never derive it from terminal success.

Writes use exclusive file creation, flush, and fsync; a repeated episode/proposal
cannot replace an existing record. A failed write can leave an unreadable partial
file, which fails verification rather than becoming a usable experience. Reads
check both the externally retained record digest and all referenced evidence,
then recompute the record. Returned dictionaries are detached. Moving the common
parent of memory and source evidence preserves relative references. Retain source
files for the lifetime of the record; missing or changed evidence fails closed.
This is API-level immutability, not filesystem access control or signed storage.

Records contain private evaluator evidence and outcomes. They must not be passed
directly to a supervisor or exported without the applicable data-use permission.
Filtering, outcome qualification, retrieval and evaluation splits remain separate
work; this issue supplies no claims about memory improving task performance.

Run the public offline contracts:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_intervention_memory.py -v
```

These tests cover completed recovery followed by task failure, failed local
recovery with terminal success, terminal cancellation, unknown local outcomes,
legacy records, successful adjustment and unsuccessful recovery episodes,
complete sealed replay, append-only behavior, portability, and missing, foreign
or changed provenance. Synthetic evidence establishes storage behavior only.
