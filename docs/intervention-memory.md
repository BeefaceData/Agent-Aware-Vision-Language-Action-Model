# Immutable intervention experience records

`intervention_memory.InterventionMemory` implements issue #95 as an offline
append-only store. It does not enable memory retrieval, select development data,
update fixed-memory evaluation snapshots, or authorize an intervention.

The trusted host retains four pieces of evidence:

- `attempt.json`, written before policy control by `AttemptIdentityRecorder`,
  including `task.instruction`, `policy_assets`, `settings.action_capabilities`
  (the serialized `ActionCapabilities`), and the frozen supervisor reference.
- The supervisor identity file referenced by `supervisor_manifest` and
  `supervisor_sha256` in that attempt.
- A decision-context JSON file retained at selection time. It has exactly
  `episode_id`, `proposal_id`, `observation_sequence`, `diagnosis`, and `request`.
  The diagnosis uses the temporal-diagnosis schema (`category`, `summary`,
  `evidence`, optional `conflicts`). The request is the original adjustment wire
  request or the serialized recovery request retained in the recovery sequence.
- The completed episode's `trace/manifest.json`, published by `TraceRecorder.seal`.
  Its observation and decision hashes are checked through `load_recorded_replay`.

Retain each expected SHA-256 when its producer publishes the evidence. Do not
reconstruct a missing diagnosis or request from subsequent success, or compute a
new expected digest to bless changed evidence. Legacy episodes without complete
provenance are rejected. The host is responsible for the truth and timing of
retained context; hashing does not establish authorship or model immutability.

```python
from intervention_memory import InterventionMemory

memory = InterventionMemory("evidence/memory")
reference = memory.append(
    trace=("evidence/episode/trace/manifest.json", trace_sha256),
    attempt=("evidence/episode/attempt.json", attempt_sha256),
    supervisor=("evidence/episode/supervisor.json", supervisor_sha256),
    context=("evidence/episode/context.json", context_sha256),
)
# Keep this reference in the consuming manifest, independently of the store.
record = memory.read(reference["record_id"], expected_sha256=reference["sha256"])
```

The result includes task, robot capabilities, policy/supervisor identities,
effective configuration, diagnosis, request, acknowledged execution rows, and
the sealed episode outcome. Multiple recovery actions stay in one record, keyed
by the initiating episode/proposal. Recovery completion or abort checks remain
distinct from task success. An acknowledged adjustment with an unknown diagnosis
is preserved as unknown; the store provides no diagnostic or execution approval.
Rejected or unconfirmed actions are not completed intervention records.

Writes use exclusive file creation, flush, and fsync; a repeated episode/proposal
cannot replace an existing record. A failed write can leave an unreadable partial
file, which fails verification rather than becoming a usable experience. Reads
check both the externally retained record digest and all referenced evidence,
then recompute the record. Returned dictionaries are detached. Moving the common
parent of memory and source evidence preserves relative references. Retain source
files for the lifetime of the record; missing or changed evidence fails closed.
This is API-level immutability, not filesystem access control or signed storage.

Records contain private evaluator evidence and outcomes. They must not be passed
directly to a supervisor or exported without the applicable data-use permission.
Filtering, outcome qualification, retrieval and evaluation splits remain separate
work; this issue supplies no claims about memory improving task performance.

Run the public offline contracts:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_intervention_memory.py -v
```

These tests cover successful adjustment and unsuccessful recovery episodes,
complete sealed replay, append-only behavior, portability, and missing, foreign
or changed provenance. Synthetic evidence establishes storage behavior only.
